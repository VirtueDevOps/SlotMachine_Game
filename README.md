# SlotMachine_Game

This script defines a spin_reels function that returns a list of three random symbols, a get_win_amount function that takes a list of symbols and returns the amount won based on the symbols, and a play_slot_machine function that lets the user spin the reels by pressing enter and displays the result.

To play the slot machine, simply call the play_slot_machine function. The player will be prompted to press enter to spin the reels, and the reels will spin and display the result. If the player wins, the win amount will be displayed. If the player doesn't win, a message will be displayed saying "Sorry, you didn't win this time. Better luck next time!".
